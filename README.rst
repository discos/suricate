Suricate is an application that reads the properties (and method
outputs) of your ACS components, in order to publish and save them
via `Redis <http://redis.io/>`_. You can use Suricate for
different purposes: to save the properties and methods values on a
data base, to integrate an alarm system on your control software, to
show the values on a GUI, and so forth. For more information, take a
look at the `documentation <https://suricate.readthedocs.org>`_.
