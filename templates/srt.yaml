COMPONENTS:

  # startup_delay: after getting the component, the job waits startup_delay
  # seconds before asking for the attributes (properties and methods)
  #
  # container: the container that runs the component

SCHEDULER:
  # A job called rescheduler is in charge of rescheduling jobs, in order
  # to slow them down in case of errors (for instance, when the container
  # is not running). This job is executed every 'reschedule_interval' seconds.
  reschedule_interval: 15
  # In case a job fails because of errors, it will be rescheduled to be
  # executed every 'reschedule_error_interval' seconds.  The proper
  # sampling time will be restored when no more errors occur.
  reschedule_error_interval: 45

# Set this parameter to False if you are running Suricate on a machine that
# is not hosting the manager. Remember to export the manager reference.
