.. topic:: Preface

   GUIs, RFI checkers, receiver monitors, backends, meteo services,
   they all need to know some antenna parameters like the current
   azimuth and elevation, device temperatures, configurations, LO
   frequencies and so forth.  The :ref:`user-guide` chapter of this
   documentation explains how to easily get them.  If you are a
   system administrator in charge to install the Suricate services,
   then the :ref:`admin-guide` is intended to be read from you.
